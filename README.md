# Understanding-Effects-of-COVID-19-Worldwide
Regression Models to Analyze COVID-19 Impact on 163  Countries

##The data obtained from Ninth World Happiness Report (2021). Which focuses on the effects of
COVID-19 and how people all over the world have fared. There are two main objectives of this
project. The data contains observations from over 160 countries for 11 demographic and economic
variables. First, to study relation between deaths due to COVID-19 and certain demographic
factors pertaining to the countries. Second, to try to contrast and compare between the countries
with fewer deaths per 100,000 population to the countries with higher number of deaths per
100,000 population. I have used multiple linear regression model to achieve first objective.
Stepwise regression followed by K-fold cross validation was used for variable selection. I have
used logistic regression to classify countries in “high” and “low” brackets based on the number of
deaths in the country. There is a significant relationship between the most variables and the deaths
per hundred thousand population. The result suggest that the variables under consideration were
able to predict around 60% of the variation in the deaths variable.
